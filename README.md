### ⚠️ System Status: Under Construction (But Booting Up Fast!)
I’m a developer-in-training who hasn't built the next Facebook *yet*, but I did center a `div` once and only cried for twenty minutes. I’m currently turning coffee into code and bugs into "features."

### 🛠️ My Current "Source Code"
I'm currently leveling up these skills. If my profile looks empty, it's just because I'm busy fighting the final boss: **Java Syntax.**

| Component | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | 🟢 Stable | Building the skeleton of the internet. |
| **CSS3** | 🟡 Testing | Making things pretty (and occasionally breaking the entire layout). |
| **Java** | 🔴 Compiling | Writing code that says `System.out.println("Why?!");` |
| **Coffee** | ⚡ High | The primary fuel for my debugging sessions. |

### 🗓️ My "Highly Productive" Daily Schedule

| Time | Activity | Expectation vs. Reality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **09:00 AM** | Wake up | `System.out.println("Hello World");` |
| **10:00 AM** | Study Java | Expecting: Logic. Reality: "What is Polymorphism?" |
| **12:00 PM** | CSS Styling | Changing one margin and breaking the whole site. |
| **04:00 PM** | Debugging | Staring at the screen until the semicolon appears. |
| **08:00 PM** | Success! | My code finally runs (I have no idea why). |
| **11:00 PM** | Sleep | Dreaming in `<tags>` and `SyntaxErrors`. |
